✅ Monetization Engine Online!

I've wired up the "Cyber Supply Depot" to the real world.

1. Stripe Payments (Real Cash)

Checkout API: Clicking "Upgrade" or "Buy" now calls a real backend route that creates a Stripe Checkout session.
Webhooks: When a payment succeeds, Stripe tells our server, and we securely update the database (e.g., turn on Premium, refill hearts).
Products Support:
Elite: Subscriptions.
Reboot/Freeze: One-time payments.
2. Ad Rewards (Simulation)

"Watch Ad": Opens a modal with a 15-second countdown (simulating a video ad).
Reward: After the timer, it calls a secure API to give you +1 Heart.
3. Setup Required (Important!) To make the payments actually work, you need to:

Get your API Keys from the Stripe Dashboard.
Create the Products in Stripe (Elite, Reboot, Freeze).
Add the keys to your .env.local file (see src/app/api/checkout/route.ts for the list).
To Test (Mock Mode):

The "Watch Ad" button works immediately (try it!).
The Payment buttons will try to open Stripe. If you haven't set the keys, they will log an error, but the code is ready.

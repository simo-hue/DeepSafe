# 🎮 Game Mechanics

Deepsafe uses a "Core Loop" designed to build habit-forming behavior around learning. This document explains the rules of the game.

## 🔄 The Core Loop

1.  **Trigger**: User receives a notification or wants to maintain their streak.
2.  **Action**: User plays a "Daily Level" (Quiz) on the Saga Map.
3.  **Reward**: User earns XP, keeps their Streak, and unlocks the next level.
4.  **Investment**: User spends XP/Money in the Shop to upgrade their avatar or buy safety nets.

## ❤️ Lives System

The "Hearts" system adds stakes to every quiz.
- **Max Lives**: Default is **5**.
- **Losing Lives**: Every incorrect answer in a quiz deducts **1 Heart**.
- **Zero Lives**: If you hit 0, you cannot start new quizzes.
- **Refilling**:
    - **Time**: +1 Heart every 4 hours (Passive).
    - **Ad**: Watch a 15s ad for +1 Heart (Active).
    - **Shop**: Buy a "System Reboot" for full health.
    - **Premium**: "Deepsafe Elite" users have **Infinite Lives**.

## 📈 XP & Leveling

Experience Points (XP) measure progress and determine Leaderboard rank.
- **Base Reward**: +50 XP for completing a level.
- **Perfect Bonus**: +10 XP for getting all questions right on the first try.
- **Boss Levels**: Double XP (+100) for "Threat Detected" levels.

## 🗺️ The Saga Map

The map is the central navigation hub.
- **Structure**: Levels are grouped into "Modules" (e.g., "Week 1: Foundations").
- **Unlocking Logic**:
    - Levels must be played in order.
    - Completing `Day N` unlocks `Day N+1`.
- **Fog of War**:
    - You can see **ALL** levels in your current Module.
    - You can see the **NEXT** Module as a "Teaser" (locked view).
    - Future modules are hidden.

## 🔥 Streak Logic

Streaks are the primary retention metric.
- **Definition**: Completing at least one lesson per 24-hour period.
- **Streak Freeze**: An item purchasable in the Shop. If equipped, it automatically consumes itself to save your streak if you miss a day.
